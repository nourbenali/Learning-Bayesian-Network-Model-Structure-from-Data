# Learning-Bayesian-Network-Model-Structure-from-Data
Learning Bayesian Networks from both the datasets : Wine and Titanic

Disclaimer : This project is done in pairs for an academic project! 

This project aims to construct bayesian networks from the "Wine" and "Titanic" datasets, and
foster further understanding of bayesian network structure learning.

The first part of this project will tackle the issue of DAG enumeration for graphs, detail the data analysis and network construction processes followed by implementing the
classification algorithms.

Another goal of this project is to not use the built-in libraries dedicated for Bayesian Networks.
